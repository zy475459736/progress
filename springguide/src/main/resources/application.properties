#spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto can be none, update, create, create-drop.
#none This is the default for MySQL, no change to the database structure.
#update Hibernate changes the database according to the given Entity structures.
#create Creates the database every time, but don’t drop it when close.
#create-drop Creates the database then drops it when the SessionFactory closes.
#We here begin with create because we don’t have the database structure yet. \
#After the first run, we could switch it to update or none according to program requirements. \
#Use update when you want to make some change to the database structure.

#The default for H2 and other embedded databases is create-drop, but for others like MySQL is none

# It is good security practice that after your database is in production state, you make this none and revoke all privileges from the MySQL user connected to the Spring application, then give him only SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE.
